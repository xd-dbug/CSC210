        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Damian Swiney, I am a student at Neumont in the Software Engineering program. I have a passion for technology and enjoy learning new programming languages. 
            I grew up in Springfield, Ohio for most my life. I only became intrested in computer science in my junior year of high school.
            I have always been interested in technology, but it wasn't until I took a python class that I realized my passion for programming.

            In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, cooking, and spending time with friends and family. I also enjoy playing my guitar and cooking. 
            I also have a passion for working out, specifically <strong> powerlifting and bodybuilding</strong>. I find that working out helps me to clear my mind and focus on my studies.
            I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow as a developer. Recently, I have challanging myself to learn new concepts in programming, specifically in AI and machine learning.

        </p>

        <p>
            I am excited to continue my journey in the software engineering field and look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead. 
            I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow as a developer. I am excited to see where my passion for technology will take me in the future.
            My future goals include getting a job as a BackEnd developer, obtaining my master's degree, and hoppefully retire early.
